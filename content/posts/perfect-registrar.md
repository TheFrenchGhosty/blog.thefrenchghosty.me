# Context

Over the year I used 5 different registrars, I started with Namesilo (because of the cheap price), with OVH (because of the cheaper price on some TLD), then moved to Gandi (from Namesilo and OVH). I also used Namecheap (an awful registrar), Porkbun and Regery (because of the cheap price on one of the TLD I wanted on a domain I don't use for now).

Gandi has been my main registrar for years for multiples reasons: great UI, great ethic, France-based company. The prices weren't good, but what mattered to me was the rest (as long as my domain don't cost me more than 20â‚¬/year each), the service was great and it was a good company.

However, something changed.

On February 2023, Gandi "merged" with Total Webhosting Solutions (TWS):

"[On February 21st, 2023, Gandi.net and Total Webhosting Solutions (TWS) joined forces by announcing the creation of Your.Online, a European online service platform.](https://news.gandi.net/en/2023/03/your-online-gandi-continues-its-development/)"

The problem? It wasn't a merger, it was an acquisition: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/total-webhosting-solutions/company_financials

When I discovered that, I asked someone I know (who knows more about tech business buyout than me) what this meant, they said that, companies often do an acquisition when merging, this simplifies the administrative burden since they don't have to create a new legal entity (this makes sense). To check if it's actually a merger, you have to check if the management of the absorbed company are managing the new entity. In Gandi's case, none of the original Gandi's managers are managing Your.Online (you can see the proof on their website), the Gandi's managers are part of the Your.Online "Advisory Board", which, as the name suggests, gives advice, and nothing more. This effectively means that it was a full on buyout.

Which mean that Gandi hid the reality as to appease users after they saw that a lot of people were angry about it.

I was basically acting in a "wait and see" phase, it could be bad, yes, but it could also be good.

The problem? The bad started:

- prices went up (by a lot, we're talking ~10% of some TLD from an already expensive price)
- some stuff that were promised to customers were removed (free e-mail)


# Now what?

After my discovery of the acquisition and multiple discussions with multiple people, I have decided to stop using Gandi permanently.


# The search

I spent multiple hours planning my move, I started with my technical requirements (that are pretty low): I need a registrar that can support the TLDs of all the domains I own (something that's easy since I use common TLD). This registrar has to register domains itself, and not be a reseller of someone else. It also needs to be in my country (France), or in a country that is: privacy-friendly, politically stable (at a minimum) and "rich". This registrar has to be in Western Europe (but not in the UK because it's a [five eyes member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes)).

Outside of this, my main criteria were good ethic and good customer support. I especially didn't want a company that could trade ethics for profit (looking at you Gandi).

I started by checking the registrar of [France](https://www.domainstate.com/country/france.html), [Germany](https://www.domainstate.com/country/germany.html) and [Switzerland](https://www.domainstate.com/country/switzerland.html), thanks to a website I discovered some months ago: [DomainState](https://www.domainstate.com/).

I also quickly checked the registrar of the Netherlands and Norway, but didn't really find anything more "go-to" registrars.

After this first overview, I decided to dig more into 2 registrars: [Infomaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com/) and [Netim](https://www.netim.com/) to see if they could be good choices...


# Digging more into Infomaniak

I started with Infomaniak; however, it was almost instantly disqualified for a single reason: they started less than a year ago to advertise on YouTube. I, personally, don't want to use anything from a company that heavily advertise their service.

I still dug into it more just to be sure, and 2 things made me stop considering them:
- they have FAR too many services (a lot of them being really young) which tell me that they're slowly but surely moving their focus away from domains.
- the domain names' prices are too close to the registry price, it means that the margin is thin, which surely mean that, if they started advertising recently, the price might go up to make up for it.

All this tells me that, if Infomaniak is "good" today, it might not last long, since they will surely decide that they want more profit.

I'd rather not risk it, and decided not to choose them.


# Digging more into Netim

I then started to dig into Netim, and was happy to see 2 things:

- they're a small company (62 000 registered domains) that ACTUALLY focus on domain names (and they have been doing it for 19 years!).
- they actually reward people who dig into their company: a promo code is given on the [about page](https://www.netim.com/en/company) to [thank people for their interest in the company](../perfect-registrar/netim.png).

For those interested: they offer free e-mail (something Gandi stopped doing) and free 250 MB basic web hosting (something Gandi never did).

I read the contract/TOS, and it was all standard for a registrar, except for a strange (but acceptable) clause that says that the client agrees to allow Netim to cite them or their website in their marketing or promotion material.

I dug into the user reviews, and they were almost all good (most of the ones who were "bad" were made by customers who didn't know how domain work and who blamed Netim).

The prices are higher than most, but still lower than Gandi, which means they are sustainable, which is good because it means that they have no reason to sell out.


# Trying out Netim

After those researches I decided to try out Netim, I started by migrating 2 (unused) domains, I was really pleased by what I saw: the UI was great, and I honestly consider some part of it better than Gandi (a registrar that *was* known to have the best UI).

Some (rare) stuff needed to be done through their legacy UI, but the most important stuff could be done from the main UI (in my findings the only things that had to be done from their legacy UI is enabling/disabling registrar locking and generating the transfer code - basically something that you only do once, when you leave).

Some screenshots:

The only part that is sadly missing is "direct" DNS zone modification, something that isn't available in most registry, but something that [Gandi had](../perfect-registrar/gandi-dns-zone.png).


# Moving to Netim

I decided to move to Netim.

I started to move all my domains one by one, during my move I did try to move a domain that was transferred less than 2 months ago to another registrar (by ICANN policy), which meant that it couldn't be transferred to Netim. I opened a support ticket at 22:00, and the next morning before 9:00 the domain was instantly refunded as credit (I was asked if I preferred a refund on my bank account) without any other questions asked. This is amazing to see.


# Conclusion

Gandi became bad, but Netim is doing what Gandi was doing, except they're still independent.

They're a small but profitable company, which means you get a top-tier support. 

This is rare to find a company that uses their good ethic and great support as their main marketing argument, so I'll gladly enjoy it while it lasts!

# Post-Scriptum

Before posting this blog post I wanted to get a Netim affiliate link, I did read the affiliate contract, and some clause were not-so-great, this is why I won't give you any affiliate links. This contract won't affect any "normal" user, so it's not a problem.
