After almost 2 years working as an IT technician (doing basically the job of a SysAdmin... for a lower salary), I was "invited to leave" by HR and accepted, I am now officially unemployed.


# What does this mean for [PussTheCat.org](https://pussthecat.org):

In short [PussTheCat.org](https://pussthecat.org) will remain as is... partially (see _what's next_ bellow).
I started to fix longstanding "issues" of it recently (moving Rimgo to another server, updating/enhancing the homepage...) and it will continue (I also plan to deploy at least one more privacy frontend).


# What's next and what does it matter for you?

I have had a plan in my head for more than a year now: this plan being to make a " [PussTheCat.org](https://pussthecat.org) on steroid "

This is now what I plan to do: I'll open my own company (don't worry, I don't plan to turn it into a shit one), and go try to do this project.

Obviously, something like that wont allow me to have a complete salary (unless hundreds of you decide to become a customer), but it's a stepping stone toward being able to work full time on what I want: IT stuff (except actually interesting), FOSS and anti-big-tech stuff.

I plan to spend at least 3-6 months full time on it at the beginning.


# Thank you

I'd like to thanks, again, all the people that encouraged me and donated over the years, it means a lot to me.

Stay tuned! I love you all! <3

PS: to be clear, the PussTheCat.org ownership wont be transferred to the company, it will remain completely independent - just with the same person behind it
