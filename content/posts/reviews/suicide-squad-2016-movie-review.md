# Margot Robbie is the only good part of this movie

The only good thing I got from this movie is that it made me enjoy the physique of Margot Robbie, that I usually find bland/don't really like.

Margot Robbie is also the only one actually trying in this movie, so much so that I kept thinking "this movie doesn't deserve this".

Other than that, it was junk with a really bad plot that didn't make any sense (the movie's "bad guy" started as a "proof" a Suicide Squad was possible and "efficient", but the good guys lost control of her which turned her in to the "bad guy" - and the way I'm explaining it makes more sense than the way the movie does it)
