# So close, yet so far...

This is a great momentum platformer... for the first world. The best world is the one that doesn't happen in the sky but in a forest... which is the first one... literally the tutorial world.

Then it decides to put you in the sky and to become a hardcore platformer with momentum mechanics... and the quality just nosedives completely until it crashes.

The first world looked genuinely amazing (I literally felt this could have become one of my favorite games). It's a world that has "solid" platform (it's literally the ground of a planet), every world after that (at least the one I played) are unrealistic platforms in the sky, world 2 has ground with trees, then every level after that slowly replace the platforms with wooden or concrete structure that when touched get pushed away.

Props to the 4th world for adding canons and bombs that literally make it so the platforms are pushed away BEFORE you get to them.


It is also really buggy:

Level 2E, for example, has a lot of platform where you literally go through them, at one moment my tongue was still on a tree, but I kept falling (my tongue just got bigger)


This was so close to greatness, but in the end... it's just bad.

I would recommend you to play at least the first world, but yeah, after that it's just not worth it...



PS: it's also the kind of momentum game where you gain speed when not touching the floor, which is fine... if the level design is made around that
