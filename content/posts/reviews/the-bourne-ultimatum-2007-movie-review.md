# Pro-CIA propaganda piece

This movie takes the Bourne movie series, a movie series about a CIA assassin abused by the CIA, CIA which ended up wanting to kill him... and turns it into a pro-CIA propaganda piece.

The story gets effectively concluded by the writers saying that in the end, the problem was just some bad apple, but don't worry, they'll get arrested and pay for the bad they did because congress really thinks having a secret assassin program is bad.

From a directing point, this movie was obviously shot with style by a competent director, but the producers really wanted to accelerate the pacing, so everything is far too quick, including exposition shots, it's so quick that at some point it was borderline vomit inducing.

In the end, this isn't a great movie, it's the worst of the Bourne trilogy by far, but it's 100% better than any modern action movie.
