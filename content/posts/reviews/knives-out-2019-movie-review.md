# An overhyped and awful Agatha Christie knock-off.


Every actor in it (outside of Ana de Armas - playing Marta) is mediocre to awful. Daniel Craig, who isn't usually a good actor, is playing with a fake accent in this, and even with that, he's not the worst one.

The movie looks like absolute shit, it's SO GREY and SO GRAINY, but none of it is artistic... it's just lazily added filters on top of the movie to make it appear "gritty".


# The (awful) writing

About the writing (the important part), the first half of the movie is painful, it's written in the worst way possible. It constantly falls into the "people are rich and talk weird" trope.

The movie structure is just broken. The movie is literally missing a first act (well, it's there, kinda... for literally 5 minutes), and then it switches to "seeing things from multiple perspectives" except it's far too early for that (and they do it so early that in the second half they just stop doing it for reasons), and the second half, which is "better", basically turns from a murder mystery to a conspiracy movie.

Outside of that, the movie really thinks it's clever (it's the usual Rian Johnson writing, the "I'm more clever than you" kind of writing) which is ironic when the movie is filled with "easy" things just so that the plot can *function* (Marta is a girl who vomits when she lies, be more lazy, please). The only reason the ending "works" is because we, as the viewer, are missing important information.


# Conclusion

All in all, a pretty bad movie, with an awful first half, mediocre second half and acceptable (considering what came before) ending. It's almost obvious that the movie was written backward, starting from the ending and filling holes as it went back (ironic when the movie loves the donut metaphor).


# Rating and Recommendation
