# Money well spent.

A film made in the style of a TikTok compilation, made to be watched on phones, so everything is shot up close.

Also referencing dozens of different movies and games.

I would have (maybe) liked it if I was 10, but that editing and pacing is so bad I'm not even sure.

2/10 and I'm being nice: this even worse than I expected.

This did cost 320 MILLIONS dollars. Money well spent.


# Rating and Recommendation
