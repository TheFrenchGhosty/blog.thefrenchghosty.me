# Technical: 

This is an absolute dogshit PC port: 

1- The game runs at 30 (or 32?) FPS + half-speed by default, editing the config file to make the game use VSync is required to get more... except if your screen refresh rate is higher than 60, the game will run faster (so you have to lock it to 60 FPS with other tools).

If the game runs at lower than 60 (including the default 30 or 58 when it dips) it will stutter. 


2- By default the game start in full-screen borderless at your resolution... except in the setting its telling you that it's running at 640x480, if you do change the resolution to yours, it makes the "renderer" bug out completely: everything becomes pixelated (the renderer effectively start rendering stuff at 480p in a *your resolution* window, any change to the resolution after that just changes the "window" resolution, the renderer remains still stuck in low res), the only way to fix it? Deleting the configuration file of the game (yes, seriously) - The problem seems to only be present if you use a scaling that's different from 100%. 


This is literally the worst PC port I ever saw.


# The game itself:


## Original thought:


I liked it until...

This is a not-too-much-backtrack metroidvania / platformer, with some precision platforming that was "hard" but still doable... I liked it, until it forced me to respawn at a checkpoint (technically the 3rd part of a "world") with only 2 health points (half a heart)... in a "constantly sliding down-avoid obstacle" part

I had no way to heal since I couldn't dance, I had no item to heal. I tried to do it 5 times, dying slightly farther every time... I decided to just go back to the "world" select, hoping that when re-entering the world I would restart at this "checkpoint" with full health... but nope: I was put back at the beginning of the "world"... with my 2 health point... except this time I could heal since I could dance.


I might push forward with it, but the technical issues alone make me not want to recommend this game (at least on PC). This is inexcusable, all it requires is to have the engine locked to 60 FPS (if you really don't want to fix the port "properly"), I mean, the game is barely functional out of the box.


## Follow-up thoughts:

After spending more time on the game, I'm done.

The game already made me replay a world-level even though I only unlocked 2.

After that, the game's third world-level's (Tassel Town) level design is so cheap: 

- Dead ends during a moment where you're being pursued
- Precision platforming mixed with enemies (including some using projectiles) mixed with timed platforming

I died more than 20 times because of cheap bullshit in that level.

I'm just done, the game has so much to like but the level design, which started mediocre, just nosedived and has become just BAD.
