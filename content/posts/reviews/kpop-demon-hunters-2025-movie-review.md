# Better than I thought, worse than the hype made it out to be

A friend wanted me to watch it (he did watch it before), and my curiosity made me agree to.

Half an hour in, I genuinely wanted to stop but I never stop mid-movie, and in this case, I was right to continue. The movie does get better.

So yeah... the first 30 minutes - basically the first act - are bad, nearly unwatchable, with bad (over-hectic) pacing, mediocre writing and forced jokes. But if you get through that, the rest of the movie is alright - it’s not great, it’s not bad, but it’s *fine*.


# Visuals

I personally didn’t like the animation style (and the fact that some scenes seem to be at a lower frame rate while others are at a normal frame rate) but that’s purely subjective, my friend liked it.


# Music

For a movie with K-pop in the name, there was basically no K-pop, it’s all American pop, which was the hard part for me since I just find pop so bland and bad. The only song I found passable (and kinda interesting) was literally the one used in the end credits, which is saying something.


# Conclusion

The movie is really imperfect and the script definitely needed another pass/draft, but if you ignore the bad, you end up with a passable, if not okay, movie.

All in all, a fine watch when you can’t think of something better.
