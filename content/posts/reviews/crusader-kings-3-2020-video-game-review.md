# Crusader Kings 2 but better

Crusader Kings 3 is basically a "clone" of Crusader Kings 2 but more polished in every way, it looks better, plays better, feels better and as one of the most important things for new/beginner players: you can actually learn it by playing, unlike CK2.

It has some bugs (especially when a new DLC is released), but this is expected, with so many moving parts, it will have bugs. The multiplayer is sometimes fiddly and sometimes has de-syncs bugs after hours of play time requiring you to "reload" your save to continue.


# About the DLCs

One of the best things about CK3 is that, unlike CK2 which was "locking" mechanics and civilizations (cultures/religions) behind DLC (in the base game you had Western Europe and that was kind of it), in CK3 nothing is locked it's all "there" in the base game.

It's a great thing for customers, don't get me wrong, but I almost do see this as a "problem" for Paradox, because effectively, none of the CK3 DLC are worth buying and if they are, they are FAR too expensive for what they add. I genuinely can't really think of stuff they could be adding... other than more "events" (which they do add in the so-called "flavor packs" - the 10-20€ DLCs).

For reference, the current "main"/"big" DLCs are:

- Royal Court: it adds "fluff" (that distracts so much from the game that most people just disable this DLC if they have it), basically a small minigame that constantly wants you to interact with it
- Tours & Tournaments: it adds literally 2 (good) minor fully optional mechanics, nothing more, that's expensive for 30€
- Roads to Power: it might be the most "worth it" DLC if you want "adventurer mode", it adds "adventurer mode" (CK3 except you don't own "land", you're a nomad), and it expands the Byzantine Empire
- Legends of the Dead: it adds a "legend" system (passive bonus) and enhances the plagues
- Khans of the Steppe: it expands the eastern "nomad" tribes

# Conclusion

All in all, it might be the best Paradox game ever, and might be the first Paradox game where you don't feel like they're "milking" the players.
