# There is nothing to say, because it was nothing.

The story is bad and actually has a massive plot hole: when Aquaman finds his mom, she knows that Aquaman is fighting to save the world... except the mom had no way to know that since she's been stuck in isolation for 20 years.

The visual effects are bad (props to that AWFUL lighthouse green screen! I haven't seen green screen this bad... outside of YouTube movies parodies).

The actors are basically ALL bad, Amber Heard being the worst: literally none of her lines are done correctly.

A terrible movie... that isn't even a fun watch... it's just nothing.

A strong contender for the worst movie I ever watched.
