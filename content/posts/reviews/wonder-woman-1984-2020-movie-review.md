# A badly written and badly made great story.

It's a badly written and badly made [movie of a] great story.

There's a great film in there but it's just broken.

I'm genuinely struggling to write a critique that makes sense because the films makes no sense.


It's a film that's completely missing what it's trying to do, there is a great story buried in there, but the end result is just awful.

That great story is seriously a strong 8 but it's surrounded by junk that has no reason to exist...

I mean, it shouldn't be a superhero movie at all, the superhero part is just useless... Wonder Woman could be replaced by the kid of the bad guy and the story would be identical.


It also looks bad most of the time, the CGI are AWFUL and nearly constantly visible (so many scenes in front of a green-blue screen)

The morale is also just weird, especially when your main villain is a parable for Trump (that's they redeem in the end..? That's not really liberal of Hollywood)... while it should be a parable for billionaires.

Something broke this film, and the problem comes from the writers and the producers.
