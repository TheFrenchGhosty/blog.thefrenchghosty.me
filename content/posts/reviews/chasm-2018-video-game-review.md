# Interesting game

It feels a bit bland, but the fact that it's a really slow paced game is interesting... It's like Dead Cells on x0.5 speed which... surprisingly works!

It's a weird mix between a metroidvania, a roguelite (but it's REALLY NOT!) and a precision platformer.

About the roguelite-but-not-really: it's a game where you do "runs" on a procedurally generated "dungeon" layout, but the run is of the whole game (you can die, but you don't lose anything, you just respawn at your last checkpoint), which is... an interesting way to add replay value.

The main "flaw" with it, I'd say is that the "saves" are effectively checkpoints (and only checkpoints), sometimes 10+ minutes apart.


As a light, slow-paced game, it's really enjoyable.



PS: On a pure technical note, the game is locked to 60 FPS, which is not ideal for a 2018 game, especially since the engine (FNA) supports more.
