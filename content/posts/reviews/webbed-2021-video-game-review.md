# A good-looking bad game.

The movement feels REALLY good, but the level design clashes massively with it.

The game is a PURE metroidvania, with backtracking and (at least from what I saw) no fast travel.

The map is highly unclear as to where you are, your objectives are vague "go do that near here".

Making webs, the way they interact with the world and "swinging" with them is great (the controls to make them are serviceable but far from great)The swinging mechanic feels nice.

The ability and the level design forcing you to shoot lasers is just bad and feels genuinely out of place in a game that seems so focus on the "nature".


The game's main (only?) plus and the reason it gets so much praise is because it's genuinely cool looking.

Overall, it's not an enjoyable game, I played for around half an hour, and it felt like more than an hour. It was close to a chore.



PS: I do find it highly ironic that a game that is a love letter to bugs and nature is making plastic (polyester) made in China plushies of their characters.
